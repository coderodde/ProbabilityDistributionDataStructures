/**
 * This class implements an abstract base class for probability distributions. 
 * Elements are added with strictly positive weights and whenever asking this 
 * data structure for a random element, their respective weights are taken into 
 * account. For example, if this data structure contains three different 
 * elements (<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt> with respective weights 
 * <tt>1.0</tt>, <tt>1.0</tt>, <tt>3.0</tt>), whenever asking for a random 
 * element, there is 20 percent chance of obtaining <tt>a</tt>, 20 percent 
 * chance of obtaining <tt>b</tt>, and 60 percent chance of obtaining 
 * <tt>c</tt>.
